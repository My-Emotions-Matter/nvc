unsorted needs:

quality
  I feel a strong need for quality in things. Things should
  be well built with indention and caring, even if they are mass produced.
  Is this a real need???
  By real, as always, I mean something that 99%+ of people feel to some
  extent.

authenticity
  in other people

mourning
  if you have loss, you may have a need to mourn

progress
  I think most people have a general need to make progress in their life.
  They want tomorrow to be better than today.
